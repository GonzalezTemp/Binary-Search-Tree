# Binary-Search-Tree
Basic binary search tree

Introduction:
  In this project I created a binary search tree.
  
Description:
  
  Create a class called MySearchTree.  MySearchTree will implement a binary 
  search tree.  MySearchTree will be a generic class storing a value of the
  generic type.
  
  It should have the following methods.  The methods should 
  all operate on the object making the call (none are static except main).
  
  All of the methods should use recursion (except for main).
  
  add() - adds a node to the tree containing the passed value.
  
  find() - returns true if the value passed is in the tree.
  
  leafCount() - Returns the count of all of the leaves in the tree.
  
  parentCount() - Returns the count of all of the parents in tree.
  
  height() - Returns the height of the tree.
  
  isPerfect() - Returns true if the tree is a perfect tree.
  
  ancestors() - Returns the ancestor values of the passed value.
  
  inOrderPrint() - Prints node values using an inorder traversal.
  
  preOrderPrint() - Prints node values using a preorder traversal.
  
  main() - demonstrates all of othe above methods.
